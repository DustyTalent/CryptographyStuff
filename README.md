A lot of these programs will be copied from the book "Cracking Codes with Python" written by Al Sweigart. Almost every program I copied will have been modified at the very least to allow the user to choose between encryption and decryption, and will let the user type their message.

Reverse Cipher - Why would you ever use this? You shouldn't need an explanation to know what this does.

Ceasar Cipher -  (Mostly copied from Al Sweigart) For some reason the book I copid from didn't have a version of this cipher that lets you input the message or the key, or let you choose to encrypt or decrypt. All of those things were hard coded into the program so I changed it to let you input what you want.

Ceasar Cipher Hacker - (Mostly copied from Al Sweigart) It brute force hacks any ceasar encrypted message, displaying all possible keys, once again had to change it from what I originally copied to let you input the message instead of the message being hard coded in. (seriously what's up with that?)

Reverse Ceasar Cipher - Instead of addition it encrypts with subtraction, no one would ever think of such a thing. This cipher could possibly fool and bamboozle many people.

Transposition Cipher - (Vaugely copied from Al Sweigart) The encryption and decryption programs were suppossed to be two seperate programs. I refuse to do such a thing. You can choose to encrypt or decrypt and I included something to let you know if your key won't work. Since transposiotion encryption works through mixing the letters around, if the key is 1 or greater than the amount of characters in the message it won't actually encrypt at all. Honestly all I really used from the original program was the functions for the encryption and decryption functions.

Transposition File Encryption - (Copied from Al Sweigart) The only program I haven't modified, because I haven't bothered learning how yet. Still need to learn how to give the user the ability to choose a file to encrypt rather than the file being hard coded in. It is so limited that I am hesitant to call it usable, it works I just don't like it.

Substitution Cipher - (Mostly copied from Al Sweigart) I jumped ahead in the book. It has the usual changes I normally give to each program I copy.
